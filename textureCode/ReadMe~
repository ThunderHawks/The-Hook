- Textures

*Lab4.cpp*
- Need to add handles for attributes and uniform variable for the image texture in glsl.
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex'

*InitHelpers.h*
- Added variables for glsl
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex' and 'GLuint h_uTexSampler'

*InitHelpers.cpp*
- Need to get handles to attribute and uniform data in shader
@Add 'h_aUVVertex = safe_glGetAttribLocation(ShadeProg, "aUVVertex");'
@Add 'h_uTexSampler = safe_glGetUniformLocation(ShadeProg, "uTexSampler");'

*Shapes.h*
- Added variables for glsl and function declaration for bmp loader
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex' and 'GLuint h_uTexSampler'
@Add 'GLuint loadBMP(const char* path);'

*Shapes.cpp*
- Made changes so that bmp files can be loaded. It also has code that makes use of the texture.
- 'DrawSkybox' function has been changed.

Lastly, made few changes in the shaders.
See the included glsl files.

Finally, I'm loading 'bricks.bmp' file as a test file. The bmp loaded will only load image size that is 2^n by 2^n. Square image size would be nice, but it doesn't have to be.
I need to set up UV coordinates for the skybox cube according to the loaded bmp image. 
- (0, 0) is top left corner of the bmp image, and (1, 1) is bottom right corner.
- As you can see, minimum coordinate for the UV is (0, 0) and maximum coordinate is (1, 1) no matter the size of the image.
If the image isn't square, you have to consider size of each dimension.
