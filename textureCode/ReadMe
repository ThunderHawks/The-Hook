- Textures

*Lab4.cpp*
- Need to add handles for attributes and uniform variable for the image texture in glsl.
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex'

*InitHelpers.h*
- Added variables for glsl
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex' and 'GLuint h_uTexSampler'

*InitHelpers.cpp*
- Need to get handles to attribute and uniform data in shader
@Add 'h_aUVVertex = safe_glGetAttribLocation(ShadeProg, "aUVVertex");'
@Add 'h_uTexSampler = safe_glGetUniformLocation(ShadeProg, "uTexSampler");'

*Shapes.h*
- Added variables for glsl and function declaration for bmp loader
@Add 'GLint h_aUVVertex' and 'GLuint h_uTexSampler'
@Add 'GLuint loadBMP(const char* path);'

*Shapes.cpp*
- Made changes so that bmp files can be loaded. It also has code that makes use of the texture.
- 'DrawSkybox' function has been changed.

Lastly, made few changes in the shaders.
See the included glsl files.
